## Hi there! 👋 I'm Leonardo Hügens and I'm doing a master's in Computer Science.

🛠️ My tech toolkit inclde Python, Bash, Vim, Linux, Git, C++, Go, Swift, Haskell, Rust andrecently Mojo.

🧠 I have a Physics background, bachelor's and master's, so I think the way I reason about things can be traced back to that.

❤️  Now I will pursue applying technology to the world of health. 🌟

🌱 I’m currently learning **Mojo**

🤔 I’m looking for ideas for a master thesis dissertation about applying **computer science** to **health**.
